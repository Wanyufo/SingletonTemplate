### New Tag ###
Simply add the new Tag to it's corresponding TagGroup in ""### Tag Group Enums ###" in the TagManager


### New Tag Groups ###
To add a new Tag Group, do the Following:
    1) Add a new Tag Group Enum in the TagManager file ( after ### Tag Group Enums ###) 
    2) Add the name of the new Tag Group to the enum "TagGroup"
    3) Duplicate the GenericTag.cs Script
        3.1) Rename the file to <YourTagName>Tag.cs
        3.2) Find-and-Replace "GenericTag" with "<YourTagName>Tag"
        3.3) Uncomment the content of the new class in <YourTagName>Tag.cs
    
    You can now add the New Tag Script to any GameObject and there select the Tag you want
    
    make sure that the Name of the Tag Group Enum (step 1) and the entry in the TagGroup (step 2) are identical
    
    nevermind, using Strings now XD so we skip step 2
    
    Any Enum can now be used as tag by making a copy of the genericTag.cs and changing the filename and the Serialized Field type
